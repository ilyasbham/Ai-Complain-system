🚀 AI Complaint Classification System


📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered complaint management system that automatically classifies user complaints into categories (IT, Food, Hostel, Academic) and predicts urgency level (Low, Medium, High).

It uses Machine Learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression / Random Forest) and provides a full-stack solution with:

🧠 Machine Learning (Python + FastAPI)
☕ Backend (Spring Boot integration optional)
⚛️ Frontend (React UI)
📊 Model evaluation (Accuracy + Confusion Matrix)
🎯 Problem Statement

In universities and organizations, complaints are:

Manually sorted
Delayed in response
Not prioritized correctly

👉 This system solves that by automatically categorizing and prioritizing complaints using AI.

⚙️ Tech Stack
🧠 Machine Learning
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TF-IDF Vectorizer
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
🚀 Backend

🔌 API Endpoint
📍 Predict Complaint
POST /predict
📥 Request
{
  "text": "wifi not working in dorm"
}
📤 Response
{
  "category": "IT",
  "urgency": "High",
  "model_used": "Logistic Regression",
  "accuracy": {
    "category": 0.92,
    "urgency": 0.88
  }
}
📊 Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate model performance visually.

🧠 Key Learning
Text is converted using TF-IDF
Models learn patterns from complaint data
Best model is selected using accuracy comparison
System predicts category + urgency automatically
🔥 Future Improvements
Add BERT / Transformer NLP model
Deploy on cloud (Render / Vercel)
Add admin dashboard
Real-time complaint tracking system
Email notification system
